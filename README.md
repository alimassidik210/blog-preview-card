## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project, I am learning how to use Google Fonts in a CSS project.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<link
  rel="icon"
  type="image/png"
  sizes="32x32"
  href="./assets/images/favicon-32x32.png"
/>
```

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Figtree";
  src: url(./assets//fonts/static/Figtree-ExtraBold.ttf) format("truetype");
  font-weight: 800;
  font-style: normal;
}
```

### Continued development

"In the next project, I want to use SASS to make writing CSS code simpler."
